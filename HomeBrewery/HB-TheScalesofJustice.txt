# The Scales of Justice ⚖
Abadara. Lady Justice. The Law. 

:
At the dawn of existence the Goddess of Balance and Justice peered into the cosmos and foresaw a world teetering on the brink of chaos. To uphold the sanctity of order and law she crafted a multitude of enigmatic artifacts and scattered them across the realms, each bearing the divine charge to preserve the delicate balance of order and bring justice to agents of chaos and disorder.

:
### The Silver Sword of Abadara
*Weapon (bastard sword), Artifact (requires attunement)*
:
The Scales of Justice is a bastard sword. The blade is unpolished and flat. It does not stain, dull, or chip. The grip is black leather that feels good and well used in the hand. It cannot become wet no matter the conditions (including under water).
:
#### Swift Justice
The weapon is a +3 magic longsword. 1d8 slashing damage (versatile).
:
#### The Learned Sword
You become become proficient with the sword, even if you were not previously.
:
#### Unyielding Conviction
You are immune to charm.
:
#### The Lawbringer's Word
***Voice of Authority.*** You can invoke the power of law to drive an ally to attack. Immediately after you cast a spell on an ally using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, that ally can use their reaction to make one weapon attack against a target of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.
:
#### Righteous Focus
***True Strike.*** You gain the “True Strike” cantrip, except it requires a Bonus Action, not a full action.
:
#### The Mark of Justice
Once per long rest, you can mark a *deserving* target for Justice.  Any hits against that target do an additional 1d6 Psychic damage.  If the target is a worshiper of Lythandia or Albion or a wanted criminal, the damage is 2d6.  If the target is not “deserving” bad things happen to the wielder.

:
### The Covenant of Abadara
Bonding with the Scales comes with a price. One must be willing to follow the Law in order to wield her power.
:
#### Blind Justice
You slowly go blind, but gain blindsight to 30'.
:
#### Bond of Order
Your alignment becomes permanently Lawful, though you remain good or neutral as you were previously. This does not change back if you become un-attuned to the sword.
:
#### The Guilty Blade
Bad things will happen to you if you commit crimes and are deserving of Justice for it.
:
#### The Warden's Calling
You gain a compulsion to right wrongs, and to bring the guilty to justice for their crimes.
:

### Attunement
When attempting to attune to the sword the supplicant is physically, psychically, and emotionally scrutinized. This examination cannot be prevented and the truth cannot be hidden by any means. If the attunement fails, the supplicant takes 1d10 psychic damage and 1d10 radiant damage. If attunement isn't attempted, the sword acts as a non-magical bastard sword.

{{note
##### Questions of Attunement
If the sword detects any of the following, the attunement will fail and the supplicant will suffer the concequences.
* The supplicant chaotic or evil
* The supplicant a creature native to the lower planes
* The supplicant a follower of Abion
* The supplicant a wanted criminal
* The intention of the supplicant is to use the blade for a purpose other than to bring Justice to the world

## Avatar of Justice

As the wielder of the Scales of Justice you are not merely a guardian of the law; you become an embodiment of divine justice itself. When you invoke the full power of the artifact you ascend to become an Avatar of Justice, bestowed with unique powers and a sacred connection to Abadara, the Goddess of Justice. This transformation comes at a cost, but it also carries great responsibility, for you are chosen to bring balance and righteousness to the world in her name.
:
### Respec Your Character

As an Avatar of Justice, the wielder can respec their character, allowing them to exchange three or more earned levels for one of the following three classes:

- **Cleric of Abadara in the Order Domain**
- **Warlock with a Hexblade Patron and a Pact of the Blade**
- **Paladin with an Oath of Vengeance**

Stat requirements for class changes are automatically raised to 13 if they were previously lower.
:
### Manifestations of Justice

The Scales of Justice grant unique powers to the wielder based on their chosen class.

#### Warlock

- Raises Charisma to 13 (if currently less than 13).
- Adds +2 to Charisma (max of 24).
- Automatically becomes the Warlock's permanent Pact weapon.
- Warlock spells are cast at one level higher than the spell slot used.
- The Sword can project a halo of bright light for 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The halo can de/actived as a bonus action. While illuminated by the halo, the Warlock makes all Charisma rolls for persuasion or intimidation with advantage. Undead and Fiends make attacks against the Warlock with disadvantage when illuminated.
- Any 'touch' spell can be cast through the sword as part of an attack action. Roll to hit with the sword for the touch to succeed. Sword damage still applies.

### Cleric

- Raises Wisdom to 13 (if currently less than 13).
- Adds +2 to Wisdom (max of 24).
- Cleric spells are cast at one level higher than the spell slot used.
- The sword acts as a Mace of Disruption.

\column
:
### Paladin

- Raises Strength and/or Charisma to 13 (if currently less than 13).
- Adds +2 to Strength (max of 24).
- Any Paladin spell cast or used as a smite is cast at one level higher than the spell slot used.
- The sword becomes a Holy Avenger.
:
### Immutable Vow
Once the change is made it is permanent and cannot be altered again short of divine intervention or a Wish. If the levels themselves are removed via those means it should be assumed that Abadara will not be pleased. This includes becoming an Oathbreaker Paladin.

Further advancement in levels after the change is not restricted in any way.
